# Feature Engineering Examples  

## Description  
This repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks showcasing different aspects of feature engineering. 
The examples are based on the **Ames Housing** dataset, used for analyzing house prices.  

## Contents  
1. **Missing data - Feature Engineering (1).ipynb**  
   - Analysis and handling of missing data.  
   - Methods for imputing missing values, including group-based techniques.  
   - Visualization of missing data for better insights.  

2. **Feature Engineering.ipynb**  
   - Detection and handling of outliers.  
   - Identification of significant features using correlation analysis.  
   - Removal of irrelevant data and visualization of the results.  

3. **Feature Engineering (Categorical Features).ipynb**  
   - Transformation of categorical variables into numerical formats using encoding techniques (e.g., dummy variables).  
   - Merging transformed features into a unified dataset.  
   - Analysis of the impact of categorical features on the target variable.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Feature_Engineering_Examples.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (it is recommended to use a virtual environment):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you can manually install the libraries mentioned in the notebooks (e.g., pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).  

## Usage  
1. Open any Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the cells to explore various feature engineering techniques.  

## Data  
The examples use the Ames Housing dataset. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the same directory as the notebooks.
